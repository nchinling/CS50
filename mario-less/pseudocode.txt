Obtain height from user.
Get height again if height<1 or height>8
Use the height value to iterate the number of rows and columns
For each row, starting from first column (index 0),
If row + column is less than or equal to (height-1), print "(empty char)"
Else print #
Move to next column and repeat Step 5. End column iteration once column = val of height
Move to next row. Repeat Steps 4 to 7.
End row iteration once row = val of height
