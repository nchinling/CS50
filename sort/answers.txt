sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Bubble sort generally has the worst running times.
The bubble sort performs better than selection sort when the list is already sorted (Best case scenario of omega(n)). This is
seen in the running times, which is better than sort 3 when the list is ordered.



sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Shortest sort time for all length and arrangement of numbers.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Selection sort generally performs better than bubble sort (sort1),unless when the list is ordered, in which it would lose out to bubble sort. 
Its best time complexity is Omega(n^2)





Bubble sort: best time: Omega(N), worse time: O(n^2)
Selection sort: best Omega(n^2), worse time: O(n^2)
Merge sort: Best Omega(nlogn), worst time: O(nlogn)
