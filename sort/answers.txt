sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Bubble sort generally has the worst running times.
The bubble sort performs better than selection sort when the list is already sorted (Best case scenario of omega(n)).



sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Shortest sort time for all length and arrangement of numbers.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Can have shortest running time when numbers are already sorted (works only with small values)





Bubble sort: best time: Omega(N), worse time: O(n^2)
Selection sort: best Omega(n^2), worse time: O(n^2)
Merge sort: Best Omega(nlogn), worst time: O(nlogn)
